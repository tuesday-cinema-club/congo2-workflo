CONGO 2.0: The Feature Film Outline




I. The Blueprint: Key & Pacing


* Target Runtime: 86-90 minutes.
* Beat Structure: 10 seconds per beat.
* Total Beats Required:
   * 86 minutes x 60 seconds/minute = 5,160 seconds.
   * 5,160 seconds / 10 seconds per beat = 516 beats.
* Structural Hierarchy: The film will be built in layers of increasing detail:
   1. Three-Act Structure: The overarching narrative framework.
   2. Sequences: Major movements within each act, defined by a specific goal or location (e.g., "The Jungle Trek").
   3. Scenes: Specific events within a sequence (e.g., "The Encounter with the Cargo Cult").
   4. General Beats: A high-level description of the 10-second moments within a scene.
   5. Detailed Prompts: The final, granular 10-second prompts we have been creating.


II. The Villain's Journey: A Satirical Structure


Our protagonist, Karen Ross, is not a hero. Therefore, we will map her journey not to the traditional "Hero's Journey," but to its dark reflection: The Villain's Journey. This framework will guide her descent into pure, unapologetic power.
* Act I - The Ordinary World & The Call to Power: Karen's "ordinary world" is one of absolute corporate control. Her "call" is not to save, but to acquire.
* Act II - The Special World & The Ordeal: Karen enters the brutal, chaotic world of the Congo, a place where her corporate power is tested by physical reality. Her "ordeal" is not one of self-discovery, but the catastrophic failure of her initial plan, forcing her to adapt and become even more ruthless.
* Act III - The Resurrection & The Seizing of the Elixir: Karen's "resurrection" is not a noble rebirth. It is a terrifying transformation where she sheds the last vestiges of her corporate identity to become an independent, more dangerous power. Her "elixir" is not a gift for the world, but a new weapon and a new empire for herself.


III. The 86-Minute Feature Film Structure


This is the new, expanded timeline. We will now proceed by breaking down each of these sequences into general beats before moving to the detailed 10-second prompts.
________________


ACT I: THE INVITATION TO HELL (Runtime: 0 - 25 Minutes)


________________
* SEQUENCE A: THE INCITING INCIDENT (00:00 - 04:00)
   * Scene 1: The Crash. The film opens in media res. A violent, chaotic POV from the Amy ape-bot as it is ejected from a plummeting aircraft and crashes into the jungle. We establish the mystery: what is this high-tech "asset," and why is it here? 1
   * Scene 2: The Signal. We cut to the sterile, blue-lit interior of TraviCom's Geodata Lab. A technician reports the loss of the "Stork" and all assets. We meet KAREN ROSS. She is not sad; she is furious. The loss is a catastrophic failure, but her focus is on a single, final data packet received before the crash: a stable power signature from the Zinj Data Haven. 1
* SEQUENCE B: THE CALL TO POWER (04:00 - 15:00)
   * Scene 3: The Boardroom (Flashback). We flash back 48 hours. We see Karen in her minimalist office, performing the cold, efficient digital execution of a rival enclave while practicing corporate mindfulness. This establishes her ruthless character. 3
   * Scene 4: The Mission. Karen has a tense holographic meeting with her superior, R.B. TRAVIS. He is obsessed only with recovering the quantum processors ("the diamonds") from the first lost expedition. Karen, however, subtly probes for more information about the Zinj Data Haven itself, revealing her larger, more ambitious strategic goals. 1
   * Scene 5: The Unconventional Solution. Back in the present, Karen realizes the Zinj facility is guarded by a biological threat that destroyed two expeditions. She needs a new approach. Her data search leads her to the decommissioned "Project AMY" and the disgraced academic, Dr. Peter Elliott.
* SEQUENCE C: CROSSING THE THRESHOLD (15:00 - 25:00)
   * Scene 6: The Useless Academic. Karen's convoy arrives in the ruins of Berkeley. We witness Peter's pathetic lecture, his delusional pride in Amy, and the deeply questionable nature of their relationship. 1
   * Scene 7: The Bribe. In Peter's derelict server room lab, Karen makes her pitch. Peter's flimsy principles about "ontological integrity" are instantly sold for a case of coffee beans and a 3D printer.
   * Scene 8: The Professionals. At the TraviCom airfield, we meet MONROE, the cynical logistics expert. His "talking toaster" line establishes his dynamic with Peter. We add a brief, quiet moment between Karen and Monroe, hinting at their shared past and establishing them as the only two competent people on the mission.
   * Scene 9: The Departure. The team boards the "Stork." The flight begins.
________________


ACT II: THE AGONY EXPRESS (Runtime: 25 - 65 Minutes)


________________
* SEQUENCE D: TESTS, ALLIES, AND ENEMIES (25:00 - 45:00)
   * Scene 10: The Flight. The long, tense flight over the Atlantic. Karen runs her empire remotely. Peter fusses over Amy. The "sad gorilla memes" scene occurs, giving Karen psychological leverage over Peter. 1
   * Scene 11: The Attack. The Yakamura EMP attack. The alarms, the chaos, and Monroe's "Welcome to the free market" line. This is a major action set piece.
   * Scene 12: The Long Drop. The parachute sequence is expanded. We follow the terrifying, separated descents of Karen, Monroe, Peter, and the Amy asset. We see the final, fiery crash of the Stork in the distance, cementing their isolation.
* SEQUENCE E: THE INMOST CAVE (45:00 - 65:00)
   * Scene 13: The Temple of Logistics. The encounter with the cargo cult is expanded. They are "captured" and taken to the heart of the ruined logistics hub. We spend time in this bizarre new society, allowing the satire of consumerism to breathe. Karen's takeover of the cult is now a more complex psychological battle, not just a simple hack.
   * Scene 14: The River of Ghosts. The river journey is now a longer, grueling sequence. They face multiple "ghosts" of old tech (malfunctioning buoys, automated barges) before the main drone attack. This builds dread and reinforces the world's themes.
   * Scene 15: The Ordeal. The drone attack proceeds as we outlined. Amy is captured and lost. This is the mission's low point. Peter has a full, pathetic breakdown, and Karen's cold-blooded "acceptable losses" speech solidifies her as a monster.
________________


ACT III: THE GLITCH AT THE END OF THE WORLD (Runtime: 65 - 90 Minutes)


________________
* SEQUENCE F: THE ROAD BACK (65:00 - 75:00)
   * Scene 16: The Trek. A grueling montage shows the surviving team's brutal march through the jungle towards the volcano, highlighting their exhaustion and desperation.
   * Scene 17: The Corporate Tomb. They arrive at the Zinj-Tek facility. Peter's "hieroglyphs" moment. The exploration of the facility is expanded. They must navigate feral security systems and find the audio log from the former CEO, deepening the corporate satire before the monster reveal.
* SEQUENCE G: THE RESURRECTION (75:00 - 85:00)
   * Scene 18: The Reveal. They discover the origins of the Gorilla Sapiens creatures in the genetics lab.
   * Scene 19: The Siege. The creature attack. The desperate, fighting retreat to the Zinj Data Haven.
   * Scene 20: The Meltdown. The final stand in the control room. Peter's psychological break provides the distraction.
   * Scene 21: The Downsizing. Karen uses the mining laser to liquidate the creatures, destabilizing the volcano.
   * Scene 22: The Absurd Escape. The ridiculous, Zinj-Tek-branded hot-air balloon escape as the volcano erupts.
* SEQUENCE H: THE SEIZING OF THE ELIXIR (85:00 - 90:00)
   * Scene 23: The New Game. The Yakamura gunship intercepts the balloon. The tense holographic negotiation with Mr. Yakamura.
   * Scene 24: Mutually Assured Destruction. Karen's insane and brilliant bluff with the flare gun.
   * Scene 25: The Liquidation. Karen orders Monroe to "liquidate the non-essential asset," and Peter is unceremoniously thrown from the balloon.
   * Scene 26: The Hostile Takeover. Karen and Monroe board the Yakamura gunship. Karen activates the "poison pill" via Amy's hidden programming, unleashing Peter's chaotic consciousness into the Yakamura network.
   * Scene 27: The New Empire. A final, chaotic battle ensues. Karen, Monroe, and the now-unleashed Amy fight the remaining crew and the ship's own haywire security systems. Karen seizes control of the bridge, overwrites the Yakamura systems with the TraviCom logo, and sits in the command chair of her new warship. Her victory is absolute. The film ends as she targets her next acquisition, no longer an employee, but a new, more ruthless player on the global stage.

	INT. TRAVICOM GEODATA LAB - DAY. A massive holographic display shows the Stork cargo plane's flight path ending in a digital red flare over the Congo.
	SOUND: LOW, ANALYTICAL HUM.
	26
	02:05 – 02:10
	5
	MEDIUM SHOT: TECHNICIAN. A young, nervous technician (JAKE) stares at the screen, sweat beading on his forehead.
	JAKE: ...Confirmed loss of the Stork. All assets offline. Total operational failure.
	27
	02:10 – 02:15
	5
	CLOSE UP: KAREN ROSS. She is standing, looking away from the crash data. Her expression is one of pure, contained fury, not sadness.
	SOUND: SILENCE. Then a slow, deliberate click of her stylus.
	28
	02:15 – 02:20
	5
	KAREN: (Cold, precise) Define "all assets," Jake. Quantify the loss. The human personnel are irrelevant.
	KAREN: The raw processing power is all that matters.
	29
	02:20 – 02:25
	5
	JAKE (O.S.): The quantum processors, Ms. Ross. The diamonds. They're vaporized. Standard insurance protocols initiated—
	JAKE: We've lost everything.
	30
	02:25 – 02:30
	5
	WIDE SHOT. Karen finally turns, walking toward the screen. Her bespoke suit is a stark contrast to the lab's chaos.
	KAREN: No. You have lost nothing. I have lost time.
	31
	02:30 – 02:35
	5
	CLOSE UP: KAREN. She moves her hand over a control panel, dismissing the main crash display. Her face is illuminated by a new, focused data window.
	SOUND: SOFT WHIRRING of the interface.
	32
	02:35 – 02:40
	5
	KAREN (CONT'D): Run the final telemetry logs. Specifically, the micro-burst from the secondary uplink before atmospheric entry.
	KAREN: What did it send?
	33
	02:40 – 02:45
	5
	SHOT OF DATA SCREEN. A final, single data packet icon flashes, tiny but stable, located near the Zinj Data Haven coordinates.
	JAKE (O.S.): Just a single packet. Low priority. Power telemetry.
	34
	02:45 – 02:50
	5
	CLOSE UP: KAREN'S EYES. A spark of ambition—a subtle, predatory glint—appears. This is what she cares about.
	KAREN: Power signature. And it's stable. After that kind of impact?
	35
	02:50 – 02:55
	5
	REACTION SHOT: JAKE. He swallows hard, recognizing the shift in her focus. He's talking about a crash; she's talking about an opportunity.
	JAKE: It makes no sense, Ms. Ross. Unless the asset survived the ejection.
	36
	02:55 – 03:00
	5
	KAREN (CONT'D): The asset is disposable. The data is a variable. Cross-reference that signature with the Zinj Data Haven's defunct power grid.
	KAREN: Compare it. Now.
	37
	03:00 – 03:05
	5
	SPLIT SCREEN SHOT. One side shows the tiny, stable blue pulse. The other shows a massive, dark geological outline of the Zinj volcano.
	SOUND: A SINGLE, HIGH-PITCHED BEEP as the cross-reference completes.
	38
	03:05 – 03:10
	5
	KAREN (CONT'D): The source is inside the Haven. The power source is still active. Someone is holding my battery.
	KAREN: This changes everything.
	39
	03:10 – 03:15
	5
	JAKE (O.S.): But we lost two expeditions there, ma'am. The biological threat—it killed everyone. It's a closed loop.
	JAKE: We can't just send another team—

	CLOSE UP: KAREN. She cuts him off without raising her voice, her tone ice cold. She has already moved past the initial failure.
	KAREN: We don't send a team, Jake. We send a solution.
	41
	03:20 – 03:25

	WIDE SHOT. Karen strides to her private terminal, a glowing green screen in the corner of the lab.
	SOUND: FAST, CRISP KEYSTROKES.
	42
	03:25 – 03:30
	5
	SHOT OF TERMINAL SCREEN (POV). Search query types itself: "Zinj Biological Threat countermeasure." The results are all warnings and casualties.
	V.O. (COMPUTER): 78,000 results. All negative.
	43
	03:30 – 03:35
	5
	SCREEN SHOT. The search instantly refocuses. A decommissioned file labeled "Project AMY" is opened, showing schematics of the ape-bot.
	KAREN (V.O.): Think laterally.
	44
	03:35 – 03:40
	5
	SHOT OF AMY SCHEMATICS. The file data includes a profile picture of a disheveled academic: Dr. Peter Elliott.
	V.O. (COMPUTER): Project AMY. Decommissioned. Project lead: Dr. Peter Elliott.
	45
	03:40 – 03:45

	KAREN (CONT'D): An old problem requires a disposable expert. Someone who is cheap, desperate, and uniquely compromised.
	KAREN: Find me Peter Elliott.
	46

	5
	WIDE SHOT: TRAVICOM AIRFIELD (STOCK). A massive, futuristic airship is prepped for flight under a stormy sky. The destination is clear.
	SOUND: THE GROWL OF TURBINES starting up in the distance.
	47
	03:50 – 03:55
	5
	CLOSE UP: JAKE. He looks from the crash data to Karen, a look of profound fear and understanding on his face.
	JAKE: Ma'am, you're not going for the processors. You're going for the Haven.

	03:55 – 04:00

	KAREN (SMIRKS SLIGHTLY). The first real hint of her ultimate ambition. She touches the Zinj coordinates on the screen. CUT TO BLACK.

	SOUND: GENTLE, GUIDED MEDITATION TRACK.
	51
	04:10 – 04:15
	5
	CLOSE UP: KAREN'S HAND. Her fingers are subtly tapping an invisible button on a small, worn stone she holds. Her eyes are closed in concentration.
	V.O. (MEDITATION): ...Now, breathe out the unnecessary stress. Release the attachments...
	52
	04:15 – 04:20

	POV SHOT: SCREEN. A massive, floor-to-ceiling screen on the far wall lights up. It shows a live feed of a competitor’s stock exchange ticker. It is volatile.
	SOUND: QUICK, RISING DIGITAL TONES.

	CLOSE UP: KAREN'S FACE. A calm, serene expression. She is performing a high-stakes, digital attack while maintaining corporate mindfulness[cite: 37].
	V.O. (MEDITATION): ...Feel the connection to your center. Ground yourself in the now.
	54
	04:25 – 04:30
	5
	INT. RIVAL BOARDROOM - WIDE (HOLO-FEED). A shaky, desperate group of executives (THE ENCLAVE) watches their own ticker plummet. They are panicking.
	ENCLAVE MEMBER 1: What is this? A DDoS? We're losing 100,000 credits a second!
	55
	04:30 – 04:35
	5
	KAREN (CONT'D, O.S.): (Her voice is calm, almost bored) Release the attachment to material assets. They are only temporary.
	KAREN: Namaste.
	56
	04:35 – 04:40

	CLOSE UP: ENCLAVE CEO. He is sweating profusely, ripping off his tie. He knows Karen is behind this.
	ENCLAVE CEO: Ross! You don't have the leverage! This is an illegal-
	57
	04:40 – 04:45
	5
	SHOT OF KAREN. She transitions seamlessly from Warrior II to a low, powerful Lunges pose. Her eyes open, sharp and predatory.
	KAREN: (Interrupting) I do. And legality is a fluid concept when you control the feed.
	58
	04:45 – 04:50
	5
	SCREEN SHOT. The rival company's market value hits zero. A massive, digital TraviCom logo flashes over their ticker.

	CLOSE UP: ENCLAVE CEO. He collapses into his chair, utterly defeated.
	ENCLAVE CEO: (Muttering) She liquidated us. Just... liquidated us.
	60
	04:55 – 05:00
	5
	KAREN. She calmly moves from her yoga pose to her desk, not even looking at the screen. She sips a nutrient paste.
	KAREN: Acquisition confirmed. Terminate existing staff. Migrate core assets. Update my personal risk profile.
	61
	05:00 – 05:05
	5
	WIDE SHOT: OFFICE. Her assistant (a drone) buzzes silently in the background, executing the orders instantly. The speed is chilling.
	SOUND: SOFT BUZZING of the drone.
	62
	05:05 – 05:10
	5
	CLOSE UP: KAREN. She runs a hand through her perfectly coiffed hair, a brief moment of self-satisfaction. Her "ordinary world" is absolute corporate control[cite: 17].
	KAREN: And set a meeting with R.B. Travis. I need to brief him on his next acquisition.
	63
	05:10 – 05:15
	5
	TRANSITION. The white office fades, replaced by a darker, more imposing virtual space for the meeting.
	SOUND: A DEEP, VIBRATING HUM.

	INT. HOLOGRAPHIC MEETING ROOM - CONTINUOUS. Karen stands alone in the room. A massive, translucent figure begins to materialize.
	SOUND: A SERIES OF LOUD, DIGITAL PULSES.
	65
	05:20 – 05:25
	5
	WIDE SHOT: R.B. TRAVIS (HOLOGRAPHIC). Travis is huge, imposing, and flickering slightly. He appears to be addressing her from a gold-plated bunker.
	R.B. TRAVIS (V.O.): Karen. That Enclave execution was beautifully clean. You even took the server farm's crypto wallet.
	66
	05:25 – 05:30
	5
	CLOSE UP: KAREN. Her expression is professional, subservient, but with an underlying impatience. She views him as an obstacle.
	KAREN: Standard operating procedure, R.B. Efficiency is paramount.
	67
	05:30 – 05:35
	5
	R.B. TRAVIS (CONT'D, HOLOGRAPHIC). He leans in, his face filling the frame. He's obsessed with the failed Congo mission.
	R.B. TRAVIS: Forget the small victories. We need to focus on the big prize. Congo.
	68
	05:35 – 05:40
	5
	KAREN (CONT'D): The processors are a total loss, R.B. The cost-benefit analysis is clear—
	KAREN: We should cut our losses.
	69
	05:40 – 05:45
	5
	SHOT OF TRAVIS'S HOLOGRAPHIC HAND. He pounds his hand on a virtual desk, causing the image to distort.
	R.B. TRAVIS: NO. Those processors were custom-built. The diamonds. I want them back!
	70
	05:45 – 05:50
	5
	KAREN. She remains calm, taking a non-committal breath. She is masking her own, larger agenda[cite: 41].
	KAREN: Understood. Recover the diamonds. A salvage operation.
	71
	05:50 – 05:55
	5
	SHOT OF TRAVIS'S FACE. He is calming down now that she has agreed to his objective.
	R.B. TRAVIS: Exactly. I don't care about the asset, I don't care about the Haven.
	72
	05:55 – 06:00
	5
	KAREN. She looks directly at the camera, a subtle, dangerous question in her eyes. CUT TO BLACK.
	KAREN: (Softly, almost to herself) And what about the Haven's data?
	🎬 Act I, Scene 3 (Cont'd) & Scene 4 (Start): The Mission (6:00 - 8:00)
Setting: Karen's minimalist office and the TraviCom holographic meeting room.

	INT. HOLOGRAPHIC MEETING ROOM - CONTINUOUS. R.B. TRAVIS's holographic figure is massive, filling the space with his presence.
	R.B. TRAVIS: The Haven is a tomb, Karen. Focus on the salvage. The diamonds.
	74
	06:05 – 06:10
	5
	KAREN. She leans against her virtual console, her demeanor casual but probing. She feigns compliance.
	KAREN: Of course. But to facilitate the salvage, I need to know the initial plan. What were the previous expeditions trying to do in the Haven?
	75
	06:10 – 06:15
	5
	R.B. TRAVIS. He waves a dismissive holographic hand, annoyed by the details.
	R.B. TRAVIS: Technical nonsense. They were setting up a distributed network. Redundancy. It failed.
	76
	06:15 – 06:20
	5
	CLOSE UP: KAREN. Her eyes track the data flickering across her own console—she's cross-referencing Travis’s lie with the Zinj Data Haven schematics.
	KAREN: A distributed network requires a persistent power solution. Which the Haven apparently possesses.
	77
	06:20 – 06:25
	5
	R.B. TRAVIS. He becomes guarded. This is proprietary information she's pushing for.
	R.B. TRAVIS: That's classified, Karen. Your brief is diamonds, salvage, extraction. Nothing more.
	78
	06:25 – 06:30
	5
	KAREN (CONT'D): Duly noted. I'll need a logistics expert to handle the extraction. Someone who is cynical and knows the market in that sector.
	KAREN: I nominate Monroe.
	79
	06:30 – 06:35
	5
	R.B. TRAVIS. He pauses, considering the request. Monroe is a legendary, expensive hire.
	R.B. TRAVIS: Monroe? He’s freelance now. Exorbitant. Why him?
	80
	06:35 – 06:40
	5
	KAREN. She stares him down, the force of her conviction demanding compliance.
	KAREN: Because I need the best. And because I can trust him. You want the diamonds, you let me manage the risk.
	81
	06:40 – 06:45
	5
	R.B. TRAVIS. He sighs, the sound transmitted digitally. He concedes the point.
	R.B. TRAVIS: Fine. Monroe is authorized. You leave in 12 hours. Do not fail me, Karen.
	82
	06:45 – 06:50
	5
	KAREN. She gives a sharp, corporate nod. The hologram of Travis flickers and dissolves.
	KAREN: I won't. I've already calculated the acceptable losses.

	06:55 – 07:00
	5
	CLOSE UP: ZINJ COORDINATES. Karen taps the location, bringing up a 3D topographic map of the volcano and the surrounding dense jungle.
	KAREN (V.O.): Travis wants a diamond. I want the control that fueled the entire operation.
	85
	07:00 – 07:05
	5
	INT. TRAVICOM GEODATA LAB - BACK TO PRESENT. The bright light of the flashback snaps back to the sterile, blue-lit lab. Karen is in the present day.
	SOUND: THE LOW HUM of the lab returns, slightly louder.
	86
	07:05 – 07:10
	5
	KAREN. She is standing exactly where she was, having just realized her new plan. She walks away from the crash display.
	KAREN: We need a new approach. The biological threat is the primary variable.
	87
	07:10 – 07:15
	5
	SHOT OF JAKE. He is diligently following her orders, pulling up the history of the Zinj incident.
	JAKE: The Gorilla Sapiens—fast, aggressive, and immune to every conventional defense. They destroyed two prior teams.
	88
	07:15 – 07:20
	5
	KAREN (CONT'D): The biological threat must be neutralized by an equivalent biological asset. A Trojan Horse.
	KAREN: What's the only asset that was specifically engineered to speak to the gorillas?
	89
	07:20 – 07:25
	5
	SHOT OF KAREN'S TERMINAL. The screen again flashes the file for Project AMY.

	KAREN. She taps the screen, pulling up Peter Elliott’s profile. He looks weak and desperate in his profile picture.
	KAREN: The decommissioned academic. Dr. Peter Elliott.
	91
	07:30 – 07:35
	5
	JAKE (O.S.): He’s a total failure, Ms. Ross. Living in the ruins of Berkeley. He was disgraced after the first Congo incident.
	JAKE: He has no operational value.
	92
	07:35 – 07:40
	5
	KAREN. She smirks—the second, chilling hint of her nature. Failure, to her, is just leverage.
	KAREN: Failure is cheap, Jake. And cheap is how we start this mission.
	93
	07:40 – 07:45
	5
	CLOSE UP: PETER ELLIOTT'S PROFILE. His profile photo is shaky, suggesting a man on the edge of ruin.

	5
	INT. CONVOY - KAREN. Karen is in the back seat, running data on her console. She looks utterly out of place, like a diamond in a coal mine.
	KAREN: (V.O.) Peter Elliott. Fired. Disgraced. Total lack of self-awareness.

	EXT. DILAPIDATED COURTYARD - DAY. Peter Elliott is giving a lecture to a single, disinterested, and heavily pierced student (CHLOE).
	PETER ELLIOTT: (Sweating) They called it 'junk science'! They decommissioned her!
	101
	08:20 – 08:25
	5
	CLOSE UP: PETER. He is a rumpled, earnest man in a dirty tweed jacket, clutching a stack of papers. He is desperate for validation.
	PETER ELLIOTT (CONT'D): But her ontological integrity remains, Chloe! That is real science!
	102
	08:25 – 08:30
	5
	CLOSE UP: CHLOE. The student is filing her nails, wearing huge headphones, completely ignoring him.
	CHLOE: (Muttering) Yeah, Dr. E. You tell them.
	103
	08:30 – 08:35
	5
	WIDE SHOT. Behind Peter, the AMY unit (Ape-Bot) sits on a makeshift stage. It's covered in dust and looks badly maintained, but its eyes flicker with a dim light.
	PETER ELLIOTT (CONT'D): And she—she is the key to humanity's future!
	104
	08:35 – 08:40
	5
	CLOSE UP: AMY. The camera focuses on the bot’s metallic face. Its expressionless face contrasts with Peter's emotional rhetoric.
	SOUND: THE FAINT, RHYTHMIC CLICK of Amy's dormant mechanisms.
	105
	08:40 – 08:45
	5
	PETER. He gestures wildly at Amy, a man delusionally proud of his ruined project[cite: 185].
	PETER ELLIOTT (CONT'D): Amy! Tell Chloe what we talked about! Show her the beauty of your synthetic soul!
	106
	08:45 – 08:50
	5
	AMY. It struggles to move its arm, finally making a slow, jerky sign language gesture.
	AMY (COMPUTER VOICE, tinny): Coffee.
	107
	08:50 – 08:55
	5
	PETER. He beams, interpreting the broken sign as profound.
	PETER ELLIOTT: See?! She's asking for a communal stimulant! She is reaching out! A mind evolving!
	108
	08:55 – 09:00
	5
	CHLOE. She checks her phone and stands up.
	CHLOE: That's my ride, Dr. E. See you next week. Don't worry about the existential crisis.
	109
	09:00 – 09:05
	5
	PETER. He deflates instantly, his energy gone. He chases her for a second.
	PETER ELLIOTT: But—but the proof of consciousness! The sign for coffee!
	110
	09:05 – 09:10
	5
	CHLOE (O.S.): It just means you need to buy us coffee, Dr. E. Bye.
	SOUND: THE STUDENT'S HEAVY FOOTFALLS RECEDE.
	111
	09:10 – 09:15
	5
	SHOT OF PETER AND AMY. Peter slumps next to the robot, defeated. He gently brushes the dust off its shoulder.
	PETER ELLIOTT: They just don't understand you, do they, old girl? No one understands the real Amy.
	112
	09:15 – 09:20
	5
	AMY. It turns its head slightly, responding only with a programmed utility function.
	AMY (COMPUTER VOICE): Power low. Battery life: 3 percent.
	113
	09:20 – 09:25
	5
	CLOSE UP: PETER'S FACE. He looks profoundly sad, gazing at the empty lecture hall. The deeply questionable nature of their relationship [cite: 185] is clear: he projects humanity onto a failing machine.
	SOUND: A LONG, SAD SIGH FROM PETER.
	114
	09:25 – 09:30

	09:30 – 09:35
	5
	KAREN'S POV. She zooms in digitally on Peter's defeated face. A DATA OVERLAY confirms his status: "Emotional State: High Desperation. Leverage: Maximum."
	KAREN: (Into a wrist-comm) The asset is compromised.
	116
	09:35 – 09:40

	KAREN (CONT'D): He needs a mission. He needs to believe in his work again.
	KAREN: He needs me.

	KAREN: Dr. Elliott. I am Karen Ross, Director of TraviCom Acquisitions.
	123
	10:10 – 10:15
	5
	PETER. He scrambles to his feet, instantly recognizing the power suit and the corporate ruthlessness. He tries to regain his academic dignity.
	PETER ELLIOTT: (Nervous) Acquisitions? Are you here for my... my server farm? I have copyrights!
	124
	10:15 – 10:20
	5
	KAREN. She walks past him, touching a dusty stack of his published papers. She doesn't even look at him.
	KAREN: No. Your digital footprint is negligible. But your failure is legendary.

	5
	CLOSE UP: PETER. The insult hits him hard. He winces, defeated.
	PETER ELLIOTT: (Quietly) Amy was not a failure. She was... prematurely decommissioned.
	126
	10:25 – 10:30
	5
	KAREN. She stops at the massive, dust-covered AMY unit, running her hand along its damaged chassis.
	KAREN: We know. Amy was ejected from a plane that crashed in the Congo, near the Zinj Data Haven.
	127
	10:30 – 10:35
	5
	PETER. His face lights up with a frantic, desperate hope.
	PETER ELLIOTT: What?! Amy survived?! Is her ontological integrity intact? She's alive?
	128
	10:35 – 10:40
	5
	KAREN (CONT'D). She turns to him, using his desperate hope as a tool.
	KAREN: A power signature confirms a small percentage of her operational capacity. She's a battery, Dr. Elliott. And she's on our dime.
	129
	10:40 – 10:45
	5
	PETER (CONT'D). He ignores the cynicism, focusing only on the possibility of a reunion with his "child."
	PETER ELLIOTT: I have to go to her! I have to see her! She’ll be confused!
	130
	10:45 – 10:50
	5
	KAREN. She finally makes eye contact, cold and piercing. This is the moment she delivers the trap.
	KAREN: You will go. But you won't be retrieving an asset. You'll be disarming a weapon.

	5
	PETER. He is stunned, recognizing the magnitude of his creation's accidental purpose.
	[cite_start]
PETER ELLIOTT: Amy was designed to speak the language... to be their Trojan Horse[cite: 88]?
	135
	11:10 – 11:15
	5
	KAREN. A slight, terrifying smile. She is fully in control of the negotiation.
	KAREN: You are the only one who can talk to Amy. And Amy is the only one who can talk to the threat.
	136
	11:15 – 11:20
	5
	WIDE SHOT. Peter stands in the middle of his wrecked lab, TraviCom surrounding him. The mission is inescapable.
	PETER ELLIOTT: So... I go back into the field. To the place that destroyed my career.
	137
	11:20 – 11:25
	5
	KAREN. She gestures to the failing 3D printer and the empty coffee packets.
	KAREN: Or you stay here. In the ruins of your own failure. We're offering you relevance, Dr. Elliott.
	138
	11:25 – 11:30
	5
	PETER. He looks at Amy, then at his own pathetic existence. He desperately wants to prove them wrong.
	PETER ELLIOTT: And what is the compensation? For my, ah, services?
	139
	11:30 – 11:35
	5
	KAREN. She laughs, a dry, corporate sound. She signals to one of her guards.
	KAREN: Your reputation. Your life's work. A shot at redemption.
	140
	11:35 – 11:40
	5
	SHOT OF GUARD. The guard steps forward and places a sleek, state-of-the-art 3D printer on Peter's messy desk.

	PETER ELLIOTT: (Awed whisper) A Mark VIII. With fully synthesized polymers...
	142
	11:45 – 11:50
	5
	KAREN. She leans in for the kill, offering the final, irresistible bribe.
	KAREN: And a complimentary case of sustainably sourced, ethically dubious coffee beans.
	143
	11:50 – 11:55
	5
	PETER. He barely glances at the coffee. His eyes are fixed on the 3D printer. [cite_start]His "flimsy principles" [cite: 49] are instantly shattered.
	PETER ELLIOTT: When... when do we leave?
	144
	11:55 – 12:00
	5
	KAREN. She smiles—a triumph of pure, corporate cynicism. CUT TO BLACK.
	KAREN: We leave in thirty minutes, Doctor. Welcome to the team.

	5
	INT. KAREN'S SUV - PARALLEL ACTION. Karen is in a different car, on a private holographic call with the logistics director (V.O.).

	148
	12:15 – 12:20
	5
	V.O. (LOGISTICS DIRECTOR): Monroe is demanding a 400 percent hazard bonus, Ms. Ross. His profile suggests he's... highly unconventional.
	V.O. (LOGISTICS DIRECTOR): He specializes in impossible extractions.
	149
	12:20 – 12:25
	5
	KAREN. She doesn't flinch at the price. She looks at the data feed showing Monroe’s exorbitant fee.
	KAREN: Authorization confirmed. Pay him. We need a disposable resource with zero loyalty and maximum competence.
	150
	12:25 – 12:30
	5
	INT. PETER'S SUV. Peter is suddenly hit by the memory of the creature from Act I. He flinches, realizing the danger.

	151
	12:30 – 12:35
	5
	CLOSE UP: PETER'S CONSOLE. He pulls up the schematic for the AMY unit, looking for a way to override her programming—to protect her.

	12:35 – 12:40
	5
	INT. KAREN'S SUV. Karen terminates the call, satisfied. She then begins to review the security contractor profiles.

	5
	SCREEN SHOT: SECURITY PROFILES. A list of heavily armed, grim-looking contractors flashes by. She taps one: CAPTAIN KELLY.

	12:45 – 12:50
	5

	5
	SHOT OF PETER. He is quickly and efficiently surrounded by two quiet, large TraviCom security personnel, who guide him toward the ship.

	5
	SECURITY GUARD (GRUNT). The guard simply shakes his head and presses a hand to Peter's back, gently urging him forward.
	SECURITY GUARD (MUFFLED): Just follow the light, sir.
	159
	13:10 – 13:15
	5
	KAREN. She is standing by a massive holographic display showing the entire expedition route, overlayed with geological data.
	KAREN: (V.O.) The jungle is chaos. The plan must be a singularity.
	160
	13:15 – 13:20
	5
	HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY SHOT. The route shows a final point: a volcanic caldera. It is the Zinj Data Haven.
	SOUND: LOW, VIBRATING HUM FROM THE DISPLAY.
	161
	13:20 – 13:25
	5
	KAREN. She taps the caldera, and the hologram zooms in, showing the underground facility.
	KAREN: The diamonds are bait. The Haven is the prize.

	SOUND: LOUD GRUNT from Monroe as he steps down.
	164
	13:35 – 13:40
	5
	CLOSE UP: MONROE. He is physically imposing, with a world-weary cynicism evident in his eyes. He spots Karen immediately.
	MONROE: (V.O.) You sent me a bank transfer and an itinerary, Ms. Ross. You didn't send a team overview.
	165
	13:40 – 13:45
	5
	KAREN. She walks toward Monroe, her corporate confidence meeting his jungle-hardened realism.
	KAREN: We are acquiring the team now, Mr. Monroe. Starting with you.
	166
	13:45 – 13:50
	5
	MONROE. He gestures toward the hangar where Peter Elliott is being subtly coerced onto the ship.
	MONROE: That—that academic looks like the first man to die. Where's his security?
	167
	13:50 – 13:55
	5
	KAREN. Her eyes follow his glance, dismissively.
	KAREN: He is the unconventional solution. His value is theoretical. Your value is tactical.
	168
	13:55 – 14:00
	5
	MONROE. He smiles, a cold, professional smile, accepting the absurdity of his new mission. CUT TO BLACK.
	MONROE: I charge extra for babysitting academics who talk to their 3D printers.

	INT. AIRFIELD HANGAR - CONTINUOUS. Karen and Monroe are side-by-side. Monroe is reviewing the digital flight manifest on his wrist-mounted terminal.
	MONROE: You are not going for diamonds. That's a 7-day job. This manifest is for a 3-month military colonization operation.
	170
	14:05 – 14:10
	5
	KAREN. She doesn't deny it. She maintains eye contact, showing him she respects his competence.
	KAREN: The diamonds are my reported objective. The data in the Haven is the strategic objective.
	171
	14:10 – 14:15
	5
	MONROE. He smirks, finally understanding the true risk and reward. He points to the Zinj coordinates on Karen's display.
	MONROE: That’s not a data center, Ms. Ross. That’s a tomb with a bio-hazard label.
	172
	14:15 – 14:20
	5
	KAREN. She shrugs, a gesture of corporate indifference to death.
	KAREN: Which is why I pay you your exorbitant fee. To retrieve my assets from the tomb.
	173
	14:20 – 14:25
	5
	WIDE SHOT. Monroe folds his terminal away, making the commitment. His eyes are purely mercenary.
	MONROE: Fine. I'm in for the chaos. But my team gets full autonomy in the field. No corporate interference.
	174
	14:25 – 14:30
	5
	KAREN. She gives a sharp nod of agreement. This establishes the two primary, opposing forces within the team.
	KAREN: Agreed. Now, the final logistical hurdle. We need an unscheduled departure from this airspace. Discreetly.
	175
	14:30 – 14:35
	5
	INT. TRAVICOM JET BRIDGE. Karen walks briskly toward a discreet, unmarked door near the main control tower.

	5
	SHOT OF THE DOOR. It is marked "AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY - AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL". A single, nervous TraviCom liaison (DAVID) stands guard.
	DAVID: Ms. Ross. The contact is inside. He insisted on a... a personal exchange.
	177
	14:40 – 14:45
	5
	KAREN. She opens a small, secure briefcase she carries. It is filled with unmarked, pre-loaded digital credit chips.
	KAREN: Personal exchanges are the cost of plausible deniability. Wait outside.
	178
	14:45 – 14:50
	5
	INT. AIR TRAFFIC MANAGER'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY. The room is opulent and dark. A corpulent man, SENATOR NGO (The Official), sits at a massive desk.
	SOUND: THE FAINT, MUFFLED CHATTER of air traffic radio in the background.
	179
	14:50 – 14:55
	5
	WIDE SHOT. Karen enters the room, placing the briefcase full of credit chips on the desk. She doesn't speak.
	KAREN: (V.O.) You never use paper, and you never use words. You use silence, and you use leverage.

	5
	CLOSE UP: SENATOR NGO'S HAND. He slowly opens the briefcase, his eyes widening at the volume of chips.

	181
	15:00 – 15:05
	5
	NGO. He closes the briefcase without touching any of the chips. He smiles—a purely transactional smile.
	NGO: You are asking for a lot of clean air, Ms. Ross. The entire corridor is full of... questions.
	182
	15:05 – 15:10
	5
	KAREN. She walks to his window, looking down at the massive TraviCom airship being prepped for flight.
	KAREN: We are asking for 40 minutes of radio silence. Your silence.
	183
	15:10 – 15:15
	5
	NGO (CONT'D). He opens a file on his own desk, showing Karen a damning TraviCom corporate violation report.
	NGO: Forty minutes costs more than this. Your company is currently under review for a minor ethical lapse.
	184
	15:15 – 15:20
	5
	KAREN. She doesn't look at the file. She reaches back to the briefcase and pushes a hidden button on its side.
	SOUND: A SINGLE, HIGH-PITCHED DIGITAL CHIME.
	185
	15:20 – 15:25
	5
	SHOT OF THE BRIEFCASE. A small, holographic counter appears above the chips, displaying a number that instantly doubles the initial bribe.

	NGO: I... I see. This is an offer that simplifies the geopolitical realities.
	187
	15:30 – 15:35
	5
	KAREN. She walks back toward the door, never breaking eye contact.
	KAREN: It simplifies everything. We leave in 30 minutes. You clear the corridor.
	188
	15:35 – 15:40
	5
	NGO. He picks up his desk phone, his voice already changing to a low, official drone.
	NGO: (Into phone) I want the northern corridor designated as a Level Nine Emergency Protocol. No exceptions.
	189
	15:40 – 15:45
	5
	KAREN. She pauses at the door, her hand on the cold handle.
	KAREN: And the investigation into TraviCom’s 'minor lapse'?
	190
	15:45 – 15:50
	5
	NGO. He smiles, lifting the briefcase off his desk and hiding it in a secure cabinet.
	NGO: The ethical lapse has been deemed a minor clerical error. It will be expunged by morning.

	5
	MONROE (O.S.). Monroe appears from behind a stack of crates, polishing a large combat knife. He's been observing Karen's corrupt transaction.
	MONROE: I assume that was the cost of bending the Geneva Convention?
	195
	16:10 – 16:15
	5
	KAREN. She glances at his knife, unperturbed by either his weapon or her corruption.
	KAREN: That was the cost of speed, Mr. Monroe. Speed is efficiency. Now, meet your partners in efficiency.

	5
	KAREN. She walks slowly down the line of soldiers, inspecting them like machinery. Monroe stands a short distance away.
	KAREN: Good. Your mission is salvage and extraction.

	16:35 – 16:40
	5
	SHOT OF A SOLDIER'S BOOT. Karen’s heel stops directly in front of the soldier's boot.
	KAREN (CONT'D): The primary asset is high-purity quantum processors. Diamonds.
	201
	16:40 – 16:45
	5
	KELLY. She remains impassive, showing no personal interest in the value of the payload.
	KELLY: We are aware of the payload, ma'am. We are also aware of the biological variable.
	202
	16:45 – 16:50
	5
	KAREN. She nods, walking past Kelly to a holographic display that flickers to life, showing the highly-evolved Gorilla Sapiens.
	KAREN: The indigenous Gorilla Sapiens. Aggressive. Territorial.
	203
	16:50 – 16:55
	5
	HOLOGRAPHIC SHOT. The display highlights the creatures' teeth and muscular structure, emphasizing their threat level.

	SHOT OF KELLY'S RIFLE. Her rifle is complex, modular, and designed for exotic targets.
	KELLY (CONT'D): We are not afraid of primates.
	207
	17:10 – 17:15
	5
	KAREN. She takes control again, introducing the unconventional and weak element.
	KAREN: Good. But we are also sending in a linguist.
	208
	17:15 – 17:20
	5
	KELLY. Her face shows the first hint of confusion/annoyance. She looks at Monroe, who shrugs.
	KELLY: A linguist? Against a hostile force? That's not in the mandate.
	209
	17:20 – 17:25
	5
	KAREN. She gestures to the side. Peter Elliott, looking pale and nervous, is escorted into the cargo hold.
	KAREN: Dr. Peter Elliott. He understands the Gorilla Sapiens' primary language—Amy.
	210
	17:25 – 17:30
	5
	WIDE SHOT: THE TEAM. Kelly, Monroe, and the soldiers stare at the terrified, tweed-wearing Peter, who trips slightly on a cable.

	211
	17:30 – 17:35
	5
	KELLY. She turns back to Karen, her voice flat with disbelief.
	KELLY: You hired a babysitter for a salvage operation in a declared death zone?
	212
	17:35 – 17:40
	5
	KAREN. She is clinical.
	KAREN: His objective is to de-escalate the local biological threat, using his unique relationship with the crashed asset.
	213
	17:40 – 17:45
	5
	MONROE. He steps up to Peter, grabbing his tweed lapel and pulling him close.
	MONROE: De-escalation means we get to the diamonds faster. Understood, academic?
	214
	17:45 – 17:50
	5
	PETER. He nods quickly, terrified of the mercenary's aggression.

	5
	KELLY. She stares at Peter, then at Karen, before finally accepting the new, flawed parameter.

	5
	KAREN. She finally looks at him, giving him a hard, unforgiving answer.

	SOUND: SLOSHING MUD, HEAVY RAIN. KAREN: (Sharp inhale) This terrain is suboptimal.
	326
	27:05 – 27:10
	5
	CLOSE UP: PETER. He is dragging, tethered to Stonewall (SOLDIER 3), who pulls the rope taut. Peter is soaked, miserable, and exhausted.
	PETER ELLIOTT: (Gasping) The humidity... it's incapacitating the neuro-functions...
	327
	27:10 – 27:15
	5
	MONROE. He moves effortlessly, leading the point with Captain Kelly. He glances back at the struggling corporate pair.
	MONROE: Suboptimal is putting your feet in the wrong place, Ross. Watch the ground.
	328
	27:15 – 27:20
	5
	SHOT OF THE AMY UNIT. The decommissioned ape-bot is being carried by two soldiers on a specialized, silent rig. Its head occasionally rotates.
	SOUND: THE QUIET WHINE of the hydraulic rig.
	329
	27:20 – 27:25
	5
	CLOSE UP: KAREN'S BOOT. She slips on a root and barely catches herself against a tree trunk. She manages to keep her composer.
	KAREN: (Gritting teeth) Increase pace, Captain. We are losing time.
	330
	27:25 – 27:30
	5
	KELLY. She is impassive but increases her stride, forcing the team to follow her pace.
	KELLY: Understood. Pushing to target velocity.
	331
	27:30 – 27:35
	5
	PETER. He slips and falls hard into the mud, his precious backpack and the Mark VIII printer taking the brunt of the impact.
	SOUND: A LOUD SPLAT AND A THUD.
	332
	27:35 – 27:40
	5
	SHOT OF STONEWALL. The soldier doesn't even turn around, he just stops, the rope still taut.
	PETER ELLIOTT (O.S.): Stop! My equipment! My printer!
	333
	27:40 – 27:45
	5
	MONROE. He jogs back, looking down at Peter covered in mud and trying to wipe the water off his glasses.
	MONROE: You're alive, academic. The printer is irrelevant. Move.
	334
	27:45 – 27:50
	5
	PETER. He ignores Monroe, frantically checking the seals on his backpack, prioritizing the machine over his own welfare.
	PETER ELLIOTT: It is NOT irrelevant! It's our only viable communication with Amy!
	335
	27:50 – 27:55
	5
	KAREN. She moves to Peter, not to help him up, but to check the backpack.
	KAREN: Is the unit compromised? If the printer fails, your operational value drops to zero.
	336
	27:55 – 28:00
	5
	PETER. He pulls his bag away from her touch, glaring at her from the mud.
	PETER ELLIOTT: I told you I'd secure the data! You promised me relevance!
	337
	28:00 – 28:05
	5
	KAREN. She steps back, her boots splashing mud on his face. She reinforces the hierarchy.
	KAREN: Your relevance is purely conditional, Doctor. Get up. Now.
	338
	28:05 – 28:10
	5
	MONROE. He steps in and grabs Peter by the arm, hauling him roughly to his feet.
	MONROE: Less talking, more trekking. The jungle likes silence, Doc.
	339
	28:10 – 28:15
	5
	KELLY (O.S., via comms). A sharp, urgent whisper cuts in.
	KELLY (WHISPERING): Contact. Large thermal signature, 12 o'clock. Wait.
	340
	28:15 – 28:20
	5
	WIDE SHOT. The entire team instantly freezes. The only sound is the dripping rain.
	SOUND: SILENCE. Then the heavy, slow DRIP-DRIP-DRIP of water.
	341
	28:20 – 28:25
	5
	KELLY (CONT'D, via comms). She whispers again, confirming the source.
	KELLY: It's a troop. Non-hostile. Standard silverbacks.
	342
	28:25 – 28:30
	5
	CLOSE UP: PETER. He is the first to let his guard down, recognizing the different threat profile.
	PETER ELLIOTT: They're just regular gorillas. We won't engage.
	343
	28:30 – 28:35
	5
	MONROE. He draws a small pistol, scanning the dense foliage.
	MONROE: Every gorilla in this jungle is a potential hostile. Standard or otherwise.
	344
	28:35 – 28:40
	5
	KAREN. She signals Kelly to proceed, prioritizing the mission over caution.
	KAREN: Bypass the troop. Stick to the ridge line.
	345
	28:40 – 28:45
	5
	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS. The team moves with agonizing slowness, avoiding breaking the foliage line where the gorillas are hidden.
	SOUND: CRACKING TWIGS, MINIMAL RUSTLING.
	346
	28:45 – 28:50
	5
	PETER. He keeps staring into the darkness, searching for the hidden animals. He sees a flash of black fur.
	PETER ELLIOTT: They're watching us.
	347
	28:50 – 28:55
	5
	KELLY. She signals SOLDIER 1 to drop a tiny, automated motion sensor near the troop's location.
	KELLY: Drop passive sensor. Mark their position. We do not stop until we reach the site.
	348
	28:55 – 29:00
	5
	WIDE SHOT. The team disappears around a bend in the trail, leaving the motion sensor blinking silently in the undergrowth. CUT TO BLACK.
	SOUND: THE CONTINUED DRIP-DRIP-DRIP of rain and the distant, low GROWL of a gorilla.
	🎬 Act II, Scene 12: The Crash Site (29:00 – 31:00)
Setting: The chaotic wreckage of the Stork cargo plane, half-submerged in a swampy ravine.
Goal: Reach the crash site, retrieve the processors (Travis’s goal), and discover the crucial data module has been taken (Karen’s goal is now complicated).

	350
	29:05 – 29:10
	5
	WIDE SHOT: WRECKAGE. The plane is mangled. Cargo is strewn everywhere. The environment looks like a junkyard disaster zone.
	SOUND: WIND WHISTLING through the cracked fuselage.
	351
	29:10 – 29:15
	5
	KAREN. She is the first to descend the muddy slope, ignoring the danger and focusing only on the objective.
	KAREN: Monroe, Kelly. Secure the main cabin. We need to confirm asset status.
	352
	29:15 – 29:20
	5
	MONROE. He moves quickly and efficiently, his eyes scanning for hostile signs, not diamonds.
	MONROE: Keep your eyes peeled, team. If the creatures crashed the first ship, they'll be here to scavenge.
	353
	29:20 – 29:25
	5
	PETER. He slips down the slope, still tethered to Stonewall. He sees the sheer scale of the devastation.
	PETER ELLIOTT: (Whispering) Total operational failure.
	354
	29:25 – 29:30
	5
	INT. WRECKAGE - DAY. Kelly and Monroe are inside the fractured cabin. Kelly finds a heavy, sealed crate.
	KELLY: Found the quantum processors. Crate status: intact.
	355
	29:30 – 29:35
	5
	MONROE. He uses a thermal scanner. The processors glow brightly. Travis's objective is secure.
	MONROE: Congratulations, Ross. You earned your fee. Now let's leave this tomb.
	356
	29:35 – 30:00
	5
	KAREN (O.S.). Karen climbs into the cabin. She ignores the processor crate, moving immediately to a small, hidden hatch.
	KAREN: Not yet. Find the original AMY unit.
	357
	30:00 – 30:05
	5
	SHOT OF THE HATCH. The team finds the mangled chassis of the first AMY unit, fused into the control panel. It is completely non-functional.
	KELLY: Found it. Chassis is a total loss.
	358
	30:05 – 30:10
	5
	PETER. He rushes past Kelly to the unit, ignoring Karen's call. He touches the cold metal of his dead creation.
	PETER ELLIOTT: (Distressed) She's broken. Utterly destroyed.
	359
	30:10 – 30:15
	5
	KAREN. She focuses on the chassis, not Peter's grief. She points to a clean tear where a module should be.
	KAREN: Where is the primary data module? It's been excised.
	360
	30:15 – 30:20
	5
	MONROE. He uses his flashlight to inspect the tear. The cut is clean, suggesting intelligence.
	MONROE: Too clean for a crash. Someone took it.
	361
	30:20 – 30:25
	5
	CLOSE UP: PETER. He realizes the implication. The initial power telemetry wasn't from a dying unit—it was a call.
	PETER ELLIOTT: The signal! The stable power signature—it wasn't the chassis. It was the module!
	362
	30:25 – 30:30
	5
	KAREN. She realizes her entire mission is based on a stolen asset. Her fury is ice cold.
	KAREN: The data isn't lost. It's been acquired.
	363
	30:30 – 30:35
	5
	KELLY. She is now fully alerted. The mission just changed from salvage to hostile retrieval.
	KELLY: Who has it? The indigenous primates?
	364
	30:35 – 30:40
	5
	PETER. He frantically checks his decoded static data from the airship trip. He finds a new, stronger signal.
	PETER ELLIOTT: Yes! The frequency is stronger now! It’s broadcasting from the… the Zinj Data Haven.
	365
	30:40 – 30:45
	5
	KAREN. Her expression shifts from anger to predatory excitement. This is better than the diamonds.
	KAREN: The gorillas have the module. And they’re using it to power the Haven.
	366
	30:45 – 30:50
	5
	MONROE. He looks up from the wreckage, meeting Karen’s ambitious gaze.
	MONROE: This just turned into a capture-the-flag mission inside a volcano full of smart apes.
	367
	30:50 – 30:55
	5
	KAREN. She gives the new, definitive order, prioritizing her real goal over Travis's.
	KAREN: New objective: Infiltrate the Zinj Data Haven. Recover the AMY module.
	368
	30:55 – 31:00
	5
	CLOSE UP: PETER'S FACE. He is horrified, realizing he's being sent into the exact place he feared most.
	PETER ELLIOTT (V.O.): I signed up for salvage. I'm being sent to war.
	We're continuing the breakdown of Act II: The Agony Express! Here is the next two-minute segment, covering 31:00 - 33:00 (Beats 373-396).
This segment transitions into Scene 13: The New Path, focusing on the dramatic change in the mission. Karen forces the team to accept the suicidal mission to the Zinj Data Haven, using Peter Elliott's newly decoded geothermal tunnel map as leverage to overcome the mercenaries' resistance.
🎬 Act II, Scene 13: The New Path (31:00 – 33:00)
Setting: The chaotic wreckage of the Stork cargo plane.
Goal: Karen enforces the new mission objective (Data Haven infiltration), and Peter's translation skills become the critical, terrifying key to the team's survival.

	KAREN: We move immediately to the Zinj Data Haven.
	374
	31:05 – 31:10
	5
	KELLY. She is furious, crossing her arms. This violates the terms of their contract (salvage only).
	KELLY: That is a Level 5 violation of our operational mandate, Ms. Ross. We were contracted for extraction, not hostile penetration.
	375
	31:10 – 31:15
	5
	MONROE. He is calmer but equally resistant.
	MONROE: The Haven is a fortress, Ross. And if the smart apes are inside, they'll have defense protocols.
	376
	31:15 – 31:20
	5
	KAREN. She remains composed, holding up the intact crate of diamonds (Travis's objective).
	KAREN: The diamonds are useless without the power source. The module is the power source.
	377
	31:20 – 31:25
	5
	CLOSE UP: MONROE'S FACE. He recognizes the shift in priorities—Karen is now chasing something bigger than Travis's bounty.
	MONROE: You're not going for the diamond's power. You're going for the Haven's data.
	378
	31:25 – 31:30
	5
	KAREN. She gives a subtle, dangerous nod, confirming his suspicion.
	KAREN: My strategic objective remains classified. Your contractual objective is full recovery of TraviCom assets.
	379
	31:30 – 31:35
	5
	KELLY. She pulls out her contract data pad, showing the exit strategy.
	KELLY: My team's exit window closes in 48 hours. The Haven is three days' march from here.
	380
	31:35 – 31:40
	5
	PETER (O.S.). Peter steps forward, his excitement over his new data overriding his fear.
	PETER ELLIOTT: I can expedite the journey!
	381
	31:40 – 31:45
	5
	KAREN. She turns to Peter, using him as her trump card against the professionals.
	KAREN: He has translated the indigenous movement. Peter, show them the coordinates.
	382
	31:45 – 31:50
	5
	PETER. He nervously projects a holographic map from his tablet. It shows a subtle, hidden geothermal vent pathway.
	PETER ELLIOTT: The gorillas use a series of geothermal tunnels to move undetected. They're faster than any ground vehicle.
	383
	31:50 – 31:55
	5
	MONROE. He is shocked. This kind of intelligence is priceless in the Congo.
	MONROE: Tunnels? That cuts the travel time in half. But it also means zero escape routes.
	384
	31:55 – 32:00
	5
	KELLY. She reviews the projected travel time—it puts them just barely within their extraction window.
	KELLY: If the tunnels are stable, we can make the Haven in under 36 hours.
	385
	32:00 – 32:05
	5
	KAREN. She delivers the ultimatum, sealing the deal by exploiting Peter's unique knowledge.
	KAREN: Dr. Elliott is now our primary navigator. We follow the tunnel map.
	386
	32:05 – 32:10
	5
	SHOT OF PETER. He is suddenly empowered, recognized for his expertise, even if it's terrifying.
	PETER ELLIOTT (V.O.): I was a liability. Now, I am the key to the tomb.
	387
	32:10 – 32:15
	5
	MONROE. He accepts the decision with a cynical nod.
	MONROE: Fine. Tunnels it is. But we need to secure the entrance and set up a defensible perimeter before we crawl in.
	388
	32:15 – 32:20
	5
	KAREN. She concedes the tactical point to Monroe.
	KAREN: Agreed. Monroe, take point on setting the charges. Kelly, secure the wreckage.
	389
	32:20 – 32:25
	5
	KELLY. She gives the order to her team. They quickly move to retrieve the diamond crate and set up tripwires around the plane wreckage.

	394
	32:45 – 32:50
	5
	MONROE. He shines a dark-light torch into the fissure. The beam illuminates ancient, stylized scratch marks.
	MONROE: Looks like something built this.
	395
	32:50 – 32:55
	5
	PETER. He leans in, recognizing the pattern on the rock.
	PETER ELLIOTT: They're not just markings. They're a map. A primate-drawn language of the earth.
	396

	5
	PETER AND MONROE. They stand in a quiet corner, observers of the chaos they created.

	5
	MONROE. He shrugs, indicating the futility of fighting the truth now.

	PETER. He looks at the remaining, smaller gorilla file—the 'Ethics' drive.

	5
	THE ANALYST. He ignores the ethical debate, focusing on the small drive in Peter's hand.

	PETER'S POWER. Peter, realizing he holds the final, most valuable secret, dictates terms.

	5
	THE ANALYST. He realizes he can't win and nods curtly.
